Board Design Rev1 Mistakes:
- Wrong footprint for the PX4 connector on the pitot. Accidentally used the same one as all the I2C busses. Already have these connectors
- Forgot to order MALE connectors that go on the board. JST female is the for the cable. Whoops

Rev 2 Wishlist:
- Better harnessing - fewer things to connect + better modularity. Then we can have test beds for each part in isolation
